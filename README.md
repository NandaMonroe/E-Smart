<!-- DESCRIPTION - Give a brief description of the project. What was the reason or motivation behind the creation of the project. -->
## :beginner: DESCRIPTION


E-Smart is designed to streamline communication within your workplace by providing an efficient platform for HR and employees to easily access and exchange information about their colleagues. With this system, employees can navigate through different departments, identify supervisors, and view details such as job titles, department affiliations, email addresses, dates of birth, and hire dates for all staff members. Clicking on an individual employee redirects to their profile, where their is a comprehensive overview, including a Fun Fact üòÜ.

Here's how it operates:
- When a new employee joins, the HR (ADMIN) creates a profile for them, assigning a company number and generating a temporary password.
- Upon their initial login, employees can personalize their profiles by updating passwords, adding profile pictures, and sharing fun facts.
- They also have the capability to check both their own and their co-workers' schedules.
- Need to coordinate a schedule change? Simply message the coworker and request a "change of schedule."
- The HR then reviews and approves or denies the request, sending confirmation messages to both parties.

Note: Administrative functions, such as adding departments, employees, and updating schedules, are exclusively accessible by the ADMIN.

E-Smart enhances workplace connectivity and efficiency, fostering a more cohesive and informed professional environment.
